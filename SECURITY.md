# Security

## Where keys live

The deployer private key, operator private key, and any RPC keys live ONLY in `~/.zshenv` on the operator's machine. Zsh auto-sources `~/.zshenv` for every shell invocation (including non-interactive), so values land in process env at runtime. Reading the source file is never necessary and risks pasting the value into a conversation context.

## Hard rules (apply with no exceptions)

1. **Never read `~/.zshenv`, `~/.zshrc`, `~/.zprofile`, `~/.bashrc`, `~/.bash_profile`, `~/.netrc`, `~/.npmrc`, `~/.git-credentials`, or any SSH key.** Not with `cat`, `head`, `tail`, `grep -v`, `Read`, or any other tool. PreToolUse hook blocks these; if the hook is silent, treat it as misconfiguration, not invitation.
2. **Never print key values.** `echo $DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY`, `print(os.getenv("KEY"))`, `vm.toString(privateKey)`, `console.log(process.env.KEY)` are all banned.
3. **Never commit `.env*`, `*.key`, `*.pem`, `keystore/`, `secrets/`.** Covered by `.gitignore`; verify `git diff --cached` before every save point.
4. **Never use `git add -A` for a first save point in a new project.** Add by explicit file name until you've checked the diff manually.
5. **Foundry deploys MUST use `vm.envUint("DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY")`** — reads process env at runtime. Never hardcode. Never `--private-key 0x...` on the CLI either (it shows in shell history).
6. **Python agents MUST use `os.getenv("OPERATOR_PRIVATE_KEY")`** — same pattern. Never `dotenv.load_dotenv("~/.zshenv")`. Never `subprocess.check_output(["bash","-c","echo $KEY"])`.
7. **To CHECK whether a var is set without seeing it:** `[ -n "$VARNAME" ] && echo "set" || echo "not set"` or `echo "${#VARNAME}"` (returns length, not value). Length leaks bits — use the boolean check by default.
8. **If a key string ever appears in tool output or commit content, STOP immediately and ROTATE.** Don't continue the session "carefully" — rotate the source key, generate a fresh one, file an incident note in `ai/incidents/YYYY-MM-DD-leak.md`.

## On-chain blast-radius caps (operator wallet)

Every project that uses an operator key for autonomous on-chain action MUST set a policy struct that caps the damage:

| Param | Testnet default | Mainnet default |
|---|---|---|
| `maxSingleMove` | 500 USDC | 50,000 USDC |
| `dailyCap` | 10,000 USDC | 250,000 USDC |
| Operator multisig | single-sig | 2/3 multisig via Wallets SDK |

Enforce the policy at the executor entrypoint, not in client code.

## Verification before any save point

Run these checks before `git commit`. If any fails, abort.

```bash
# 1. No private-key-shaped strings in staged content
git diff --cached | grep -E '(0x[a-f0-9]{64}|PRIVATE_KEY *= *0x|secret *= *")' && echo "ABORT: key in staged diff"

# 2. No env files staged
git diff --cached --name-only | grep -E '(^\.env|/\.env|\.envrc$|\.key$|\.pem$)' && echo "ABORT: env file staged"

# 3. No literal-32-byte hex in source
grep -rE "0x[0-9a-fA-F]{64}" --include="*.sol" --include="*.py" --include="*.ts" --include="*.js" --include="*.json" . | grep -v 'test/' | grep -v 'mocks/' && echo "REVIEW: long hex string in source"
```

## What to do if a key leaks

1. Stop. No more tool calls that touch keys.
2. Rotate the source key (re-issue from Privy/Turnkey/wallet).
3. If the wallet holds funds: `transferOwnership` the executor to a fresh operator address while the old key still works, OR pause via on-chain emergency switch.
4. Update `~/.zshenv` with the new key (operator does this manually, NEVER an AI).
5. File an incident note in `ai/incidents/YYYY-MM-DD-leak.md` with: what leaked, how, blast radius, mitigation timeline.
6. Add the failure mode to the project's threat model in `ai/sponsor-integration.md`.

## Default deny

If any tool, hook, or workflow is unclear about whether it might touch a key — assume YES and apply the rules. This file is the canonical source. Project-level deviations require explicit operator approval.
